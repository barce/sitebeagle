Sitebeagle watches a site for you.

By: barce


Note: We are moving sitebeagle to Ruby using OAuth authentication. 
The newLISP part was cool and I got to find out about new things, but
right now I just need something that works & now. - barce 9/29/2010



requirements:
  curl
  twitter account from http://twitter.com/ for sending changes / outages
	twitter account from http://twitter.com/ for receiving changes / outages
  ruby


how to use:
  =1= get a consumer_key and consumer_secret for this application from twitter
  =2= put those into a file called auth.yaml
  =3= edit get_oauth.rb. point it to auth.yaml and set oauth_confirm_url .
  =4= run get_oauth.rb
  =5= note values for access_token and access_secret
  =6= put those values into auth.yaml
  =7= run sitebeagle.rb by typing: ./sitebeagle.rb http://example.com 5

known issues:
	if a site changes its html each time when you go to it, sitebeagle won't work
