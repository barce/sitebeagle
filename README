Sitebeagle watches a site for you.

The newLISP part was cool and I got to find out about new things, but
right now I just need something that works & now. - barce 9/29/2010



requirements:
  curl
  twitter account from http://twitter.com/ for sending changes / outages
	twitter account from http://twitter.com/ for receiving changes / outages
  newlisp 10.0 or greater


how to use:
	open checksite.lsp in an editor.
	where it says EDIT BELOW put in the necessary info:
		twitter sender account
		twitter sender account password
		twitter recipient, person who gets twitters saying site is down
	start sitebeagle:
		./checksite.lsp http://example.com/ number_of_tweets_to_send_if_site_changed

  example: 
    ./checksite.lsp http://codebelay.com/ 1 ""

  example with regex:
    ./checksite.lsp http://www.codebelay.com/ 1 "February.*"

known issues:
	if a site always changes its html when you go to it, sitebeagle won't work,
  unless a regex is used.

  please use a regex to track only the parts of a page you want to track.
